# Basics of Regression – ML Practice

This branch focuses on learning the foundational concepts of **regression in machine learning**, as part of my journey through Krish Naik's ML tutorials. It includes practical implementation using Python and Google Colab notebooks.

## 📘 Topics Covered

1. **Simple Linear Regression**
   - 📁 `simple_regression_height_weight.ipynb`
   - Predicting weight based on height using a single independent variable.

2. **Multiple Linear Regression** *(Coming Soon)*
   - 📁 `multiple_regression_example.ipynb` *(to be added)*
   - Modeling with more than one independent variable to predict outcomes.

## 📌 Key Concepts Practiced
- Data preprocessing and visualization
- Understanding linear relationships
- Using `sklearn` for regression models
- Model evaluation using R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## 📂 How to Use
You can open these notebooks directly in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or download them for local use.

## 🚧 Next Steps
- Add more notebooks on multiple regression
- Include notes on assumptions, diagnostics, and evaluation metrics
- Add markdown explanations for each notebook
